He got his second shot of Pfizer in april. Exactly two weeks later, he suffered three attacks in 48 hours caused by brain clots,  and spent 5 days in the hospital.

He has mostly recovered now, he's quite strong for his age, and had no problems whatsoever of this kind before.

You know what's most shocking to me ? When I went to visit him at the hospital, I talked to the doctor who has taking care of him. I asked him if the blood clots could be related to the vaccine. The good doctor shrugged it off and told me that it could not under any circumstances be caused by the vaccine.

So of course this was never counted as a possible side effect, and I'm sure that there are many such cases. It's obvious that if you don't look out for them, there will be no side effects at all.

My country has no VAERS system, so it will never be counted. As for myself, there's no way I'll get the jab.",Vaccine side effects: brain blood clot,1

Unless it is required for medical treatment, there's no good reason to get tested and yet there are many reasons not to:

* It's expensive and a huge taxpayer burden
   * [In Canada they cost taxpayers almost $50 per test](https://toronto.citynews.ca/2020/09/30/680-news-ontario-pharmacies-testing-reimburse-covid-money/)
   * One [study](https://www.ahip.org/new-study-covid-19-testing-costs/) found that Covid testing could cost $25 Billion per year in the U.S.
* It continues to fuel the fear-mongering media's narrative
   * Despite being an almost entirely worthless metric, news, health and government agencies continue to use ""positive"" cases as justification for their agendas. 
   * Even the hospitalizations and deaths metric is so out of whack because they are testing everybody, regardless of root cause. 
* The tests have been shown to be inaccurate and potentially unsafe
   * Even a [Reuters fact check](https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-factcheck-pcr-idUSKBN24420X) had to admit:

&gt; It is important to note that detecting viral material by PCR does not indicate that the virus is fully intact and infectious, i.e. able to cause infection in other people. The isolation of infectious virus from positive individuals requires virus culture methods. These methods can only be conducted in laboratories with specialist containment facilities and are time consuming and complex. 

* The [FDA recalled](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/stop-using-innova-medical-group-sars-cov-2-antigen-rapid-qualitative-test-fda-safety-communication) a certain brand of test because it was inaccurate and it just so happened to be the type of test that is ""[the cornerstone of the UK’s mass testing programme](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1514).""

According to the article, 

What they don’t say is that the state has been letting water out of reservoirs across California for months now. And it’s not going to farmers, growers, ranchers or urban use. Environmental policy says the water “flows” from reservoirs are necessary to produce a rebound of endangered Delta smelt and Chinook salmon. However, these policies are a failure as neither species have been collected in all of the latest trawling surveys, where they spend several days a month searching in more than 200 spots.

Meanwhile, as the reservoir water flows are not saving fish at all, the State of California has known we are heading into a multi year drought. But northern reservoir managers have continued to release water through the Delta, and into the Pacific Ocean anyway.

“Less than two years ago, every reservoir in the state was brimming with water, and held a supply to last a minimum of five dry years without another drop of rain. Shasta and Oroville by themselves held enough water to meet the needs of 80 million people for a year. With 25 million receiving water from these sources, those two reservoirs alone could deliver water for more than three years. But the majority of that stored water has been released to the ocean for ongoing environmental causes that have not benefitted a single endangered fish. Water managers claim the problem is families are not conserving enough. They are now recommending only using water for drinking and sanitation, and to stop watering any landscape that is not edible. Many property owners are already trucking in water.”",California is dumping water into the ocean during a drought. It is supposedly to save fish. It hasn't worked for 30 years but they are keeping at it. 2 years ago there was enough water for every Californian for years. Now it is alarmingly low.,1
